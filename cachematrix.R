## The following two functions cache the inverse of a matrix,
## to allow the matrix to be returned without the need for additional
## calculation if it previously has been calculated

## Function makeCacheMatrix returns a matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(solve) i <<- solve
        getinverse <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Object cacheSolve computes the 
## inverse of the above matrix, making use of the cache
## if the inverse has been calculated and the matrix has not been changed.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        i <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(i)
        i
